An "online shopping code" is a promotional or discount code that customers enter at checkout to receive a special offer, such as a percentage off, a fixed amount off, or free shipping. These codes, also known as promo codes, coupon codes, or voucher codes, are used by businesses as a marketing strategy to attract new customers, reward existing ones, and boost sales. Customers benefit from savings, while retailers use them to track marketing effectiveness and increase conversions.
